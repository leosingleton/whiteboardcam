WhiteboardCam is an app for capturing and live streaming whiteboards.
Use any Apple device as a whiteboard camera to turn a physical whiteboard into a virtual smartboard for
collaboration.
WhiteboardCam uses AI algorithms to compliment online meeting software by delivering crisp, high-resolution
views of whiteboards, replacing the typical blurry, hard-to-read video stream from a standard webcam.
WhiteboardCam supports all iPhone and iPad devices, along with macOS laptops and desktops (an external 4K
webcam is recommended for maximum quality).
