[WhiteboardCam](https://whiteboardcam.com) is an app for capturing and live streaming whiteboards.
Use any iPhone or Android as a whiteboard camera to turn a physical whiteboard into a virtual smartboard for
collaboration.
WhiteboardCam compliments online meeting software by delivering sharp, clear views of whiteboards, replacing the typical
blurry, hard-to-read video stream from a standard webcam.
